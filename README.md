An AI-powered game and movie recommendation tool.

You don't need to remember titles or study complex tags.

Just describe what you're looking for in natural language:

* What game you want to play
* What movie or TV show you want to watch
* What style you prefer
* What types you dislike

AI will understand your description and find the best matches from the library.

## 💡 Why I Built This

Most recommendation systems require users to:

* Know exactly what they're looking for
* Use complex filters
* Be familiar with categories and tags

I usually don't know what I want to play or watch. I just want something that "feels right."

So I built this.
